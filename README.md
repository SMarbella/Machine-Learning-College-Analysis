# Machine Learning College Analysis
This project uses the College dataset from https://book.huihoo.com/introduction-to-statistical-learning/College.csv. It relates to a college data set with variables for 777 different universities and colleges in the US. I used the R programming language and machine learning techniques that answered the prompting questions.
