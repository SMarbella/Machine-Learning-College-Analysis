# Machine Learning College Analysis
This project uses the College dataset from https://book.huihoo.com/introduction-to-statistical-learning/College.csv. It relates to a college data set with variables for 777 different universities and colleges in the US. I used the R programming language and machine learning techniques that answered the prompting questions. 

## Table Columns
-	`Private` : Public/private indicator
-	`Apps` : Number of applications received
-	`Accept` : Number of applicants accepted
-	`Enroll` : Number of new students enrolled
-	`Top10perc` : New students from top 10 % of high school class
-	`Top25perc` : New students from top 25 % of high school class
-	`F.Undergrad` : Number of full-time undergraduates
-	`P.Undergrad` : Number of part-time undergraduates
-	`Outstate`  : Out-of-state tuition
-	`Room.Board` : Room and board costs
-	`Books` : Estimated book costs
-	`Personal` : Estimated personal spending
-	`PhD` : Percent of faculty with Ph.D.â€™s
-	`Terminal` : Percent of faculty with terminal degree
-	`S.F.Ratio` : Student/faculty ratio
-	`perc.alumni` : Percent of alumni who donate
-	`Expend` : Instructional expenditure per student
-	`Grad.Rate` : Graduation rate

## Summary Table
![Image](https://github.com/SMarbella/Machine-Learning-College-Analysis/blob/main/Images/Summary%20Table.png)
- **Figure 1.** A numerical summary of the variables in the data set.

In Figure 1, the numerical summary analyzes each variable's minimum numbers, first quartiles, medians, means, third quartiles, and maximum values. These values give a brief analysis of the differences between the variables. There are more private universities than public universities throughout the United States. The average percentage of faculty with PhD degrees is 72%.

## Scattered Plot Pairs

- **Figure 2.** Scattered plots describing the relationships between each variable.

In Figure 2, there is a list of all possible combinations between the variables. The scattered plots include all observations from each variable.

## Out-of-State Tuition Prices in Universities and Colleges in the US

- **Figure 3.** Box plot comparing out-of-state tuition prices of private and public universities.

In Figure 3, public universities have cheaper out-of-state tuition prices than private universities.

## Number of Elite Universities

- **Figure 4.** Box plot comparing the out-of-state tuition costs of colleges and elite colleges.

In Figure 4, elite universities have higher out-of-state tuition costs than non-elite universities.
